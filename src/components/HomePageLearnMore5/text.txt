                            The process starts with digital design creation
                            using 3D design software. Designers at HAMS use
                            tools like Clo3D to visualize garments in a three -
                            dimensional space.

                          <p>
                            Virtual prototyping allows designers to create a
                            digital representation of the garment, including
                            details like fabric texture, color, and patterns.
                            This helps in assessing the overall look and feel of
                            the design.

                            Designers can make real-time adjustments to the fit
                            and pattern of the garment within the 3D
                            environment. This enables them to fine-tune details
                            such as sizing, proportions, and seam placements.

                            The 3D design software enables realistic material
                            simulation, allowing designers to visualize how

                            virtual garment. This aids in the selection of

                            software facilitate communication between designers,
                            pattern makers, and other stakeholders. Real-time
                            feedback can be provided, streamlining the design

                            3D design significantly reduces the need for
                            physical samples, saving both time and resources.
                            Designers can experiment with various design
                            iterations digitally before finalizing the prototype
                            for physical production.

                            Once the virtual prototype is ready, it can be

                            The ability to visualize and make adjustments in a
                            3D environment helps reduce the number of physical
                            iterations needed, leading to faster and more
